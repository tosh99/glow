She instantly recommended me a list of Biologique Research Products. I was apprehensive at first as I couldnâ€™t believe that any product could change  my skin texture changed within a matter of 20 days. My acne marks lightened and I had a smooth even texture on my big day. I have seen a visible reduction in my pore size and wrinkles. I canâ€™t be more thankful to her. Varshini is super patient and really listens to you. She also has eye to understand your aesthetic and personality before she is recommending products and procedures to you by giving you the space to choose rather than hard selling. Thank you for the new skin revelation at age of 36. Absolutely love it ðŸ’“ðŸ¤—'

I was always always worried about my skin and even after trying so many high brand stuff and spending loads of money, I never got the results I was after. After online consultation with Dr. Varshini and starting with all the products and routine suggested, I have the skin of my dreams!! All my major concerns : acne, acne scars, uneven and dull skin tone; everything was taken care of by the products recommended. The best part about Glow Clinic is one can have online consultations and Dr. Varshini patiently listens to all your worries and explains everything. Makes you understand why a product is to be used. Thank you doctor for being so patient and kind and helping me have the skin I have always longed for. So lucky to have you!!'

Thereâ€™s no better ambassador for what a solid and consistent skincare routine can do for you than Dr. Varshini herself :blush:.Before I started on my BR journey with Glow - I used to hide under layers of makeup. I would change my skincare routine every few weeks based on a random Instagram post by some beauty editor, influencer or magazine list. It was when my skin had a bad reaction to one of my these experiments that I decided I needed to completely overhaul my approach.I now own a drawer full of foundations that I barely use. Today my skin is at a place where I donâ€™t feel the need to use makeup on a daily basis. Itâ€™s even, glowy and hydrated.I see Dr. Varshini regularly and she takes the time to listen to my concerns and gives me a simple skincare regimen thatâ€™s easy to follow. She patiently takes me through how to use each product.Iâ€™m glad Hyderabad has a state of the art full service skincare clinic and Iâ€™m excited to try the many treatments Glow has to offer.'
