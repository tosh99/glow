She instantly recommended me a list of Biologique Research Products. I was apprehensive at first as I couldnâ€™t believe that any product could change  my skin texture changed within a matter of 20 days. My acne marks lightened and I had a smooth even texture on my big day. I have seen a visible reduction in my pore size and wrinkles. I canâ€™t be more thankful to her. Varshini is super patient and really listens to you. She also has eye to understand your aesthetic and personality before she is recommending products and procedures to you by giving you the space to choose rather than hard selling. Thank you for the new skin revelation at age of 36. Absolutely love it ðŸ’“ðŸ¤—'

I was always always worried about my skin and even after trying so many high brand stuff and spending loads of money, I never got the results I was after. After online consultation with dr.

All my major concerns: acne, acne scars, uneven and dull skin tone: everything was taken care of by the products recommended.\n' +
